# ImageTranslate
A Image-To-Text translator

This was a personal projec.  I wanted to read like Japanese mangas or play Visual Novels that I could not understand.
So I came up with a idea of 'Wouldn't it be wonderful to translate anything on my screen'...  So this is the result and works wonderful.

shortcut keys:</br>
F4 = allows user to capture a particular image (basically a built in snipping tool).</br>
F4 again to finish "snipping"

YOu can translate form a image file(default when you click the load button) or from clipboard (ex, Ctrl+C/Copy Image/Prt Scrn/F4)

This uses Googles&#169; Tesseract Library.  This app can translate 50 languages atm.

Last Note:  I have Google Translator implemented.  It is disabled by default.  It used to work but google may have changed the web link/access key

Note: If there are compile issues then run build.bat in tesseract folder
